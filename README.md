# Japanese_Restaurant_Website

The primary objective of this website was to create brand awareness for a restaurant that faced challenges during the pandemic. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I took charge of the entire design and photography process, incorporating various design, programming, and marketing concepts learned from my courses. The aim was to build a project from the ground up, enabling me to contribute to the brand's marketing efforts and attract a larger clientele.
